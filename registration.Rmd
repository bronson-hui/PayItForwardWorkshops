Registration is a two-step process:

First, you express interest in participating through the registration link (HERE). If there are still spots available, we will share another link at the end of the form, where you, as the second step, upload your donation receipt within 48 hours. It is only when **both** steps are completed that the registration is successful. When we do not receive a receipt within the said time frame, we will free up your spots for other interested participants. 

We ask that you register only if you are available for the all sessions (all four sessions on both days). To maintain the quality of learning and teaching, we can only accept 25 participants.
