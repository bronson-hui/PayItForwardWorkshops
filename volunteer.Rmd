We are looking for volunteers to play the following roles in our workshop. Please click here to register. 

# Teaching Assistant (TA)
TAs help monitor the chat during the instructor's presentation to address any questions that may come up. They will also be the leader during break-out-room practice sessions. We require TAs to have experience in using R in their own research (in addition to attending a class that teaches R).

# Project Coordinator (PC)
PCs will help with administrative tasks such as registration, communication between instructors, TAs, and participants.
