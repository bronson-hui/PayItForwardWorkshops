## Goals
By the end of this workshop, you will:

* Use R Studio to develop and execute code that can analyze your data
* Use R to assist you in cleaning your data for analysis
* Use R to render publishable quality visualizations of your data
* Utilize the help features in R to troubleshoot your R code
* Draw on open source and publicly available resources to troubleshoot R code to meet your data analysis needs

## Dates and Time 
31 July, 2021 - 1 August, 2021 (Sat and Sun)

9 am - 4 pm (US Eastern Time)

There are a total four 3-hour sessions. Morning sessions run from 9 am to 12 noon, and afternoon sessions run from 1 pm - 4 pm. 

## Format 
Fully online via Zoom (synchronous)

## Fees
The workshop itself is free. But, we ask that participants donate no less than US$50 (or an equivalent amount in any local currency) to a charity that has been offering help during the COVID pandemic. It can be a church, a food bank, a charity. All registrants will be asked to upload a receipt of their donation before we confirm your registration. 

## Materials
We will take advantage of open data and code generously shared by researchers in the field. So, we will be playing with data that we have good background knowledge. Participants can also read the publication(s) associated with the data ahead of time to familiarize themselves with the context. Additional code used in the workshop will be made available on this website as well.
