# Update: 
Thank you for your support. As of July 6, we have had more participants than we can take. Therefore, we are running a wait list. We will notify you to go through the following steps when a spot becomes available. [Here](https://tinyurl.com/PIFwaiting) is the link. Thank you once again. 

# Steps:

We ask that you register only if you are available for the all sessions (all four sessions on both days). To maintain the quality of learning and teaching, we can only accept 25 participants

Registration is a three-step process:

1. Express an interest in participating through the registration link ([https://tinyurl.com/PIFinterest](https://tinyurl.com/PIFinterest)). If there are still spots available, we will share another link at the end of the form. Copy that link for Step 3 below. 

2. Make your donation and obtain a receipt. The amount needs to be equivalent to at least US$50 (any local currencies are fine! Yes, help your local charities).

3. Upload your donation receipt within 48 hours to the link that you saved in Step 1.  


It is only when **all three** steps are completed that the registration is successful. When we do not receive a receipt within the said time frame, we will free up your spots for other interested participants. Please note that if you make your donation without going through Step 1, you risk that we no longer have a spot reserved for you.
