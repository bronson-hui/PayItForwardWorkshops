Registration is a two-step process:

First, you express an interest in participating through the registration link ([https://tinyurl.com/PIFinfo](https://tinyurl.com/PIFinfo)). If there are still spots available, we will share another link at the end of the form, where you, as the second step, upload your donation receipt within 48 hours. The amount needs to be equivalent to at least US$50 (any local currencies are fine! Yes, help your local charities). It is only when **both** steps are completed that the registration is successful. When we do not receive a receipt within the said time frame, we will free up your spots for other interested participants. 

We ask that you register only if you are available for the all sessions (all four sessions on both days). To maintain the quality of learning and teaching, we can only accept 25 participants.
